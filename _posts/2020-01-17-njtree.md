For this tutorial series, we will be using the _genlight_ object that we created in the previous tutorial. 
Original data in _HapMap_ format used in TASSEL was converted to _genlight_ object. 

#### Import library

```r
library(LDcorSV)
library(adegenet)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(tidyverse)
library(dpaudelR)
```
#### Import library to draw phylogenetic tree

```
library(ape)
```

#### Create tree

```
tre <- nj(dist(as.matrix(b)))
```

#### Plot the Neighbor Joining tree

```
plot(tre, typ="fan", cex=0.7)
title("NJ tree")
```
