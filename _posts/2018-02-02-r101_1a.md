## Data set

We will be using iris dataset from [R. A. Fisher's famous research.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x/abstract)
Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbiology/rbiology.github.io/master/_data/irisdata.csv) to download a .csv file of the document and save it as _irisdata.csv_.

For the purpose of this tutorial, I have a folder called **r101** on my **Desktop**. I have downloaded _irisdata.csv_ inside this folder.


## Set working directory

I will set my **working directory** to the folder **r101** where _irisdata.csv_ is located.

```r
setwd("~/Desktop/r101")
```
This sets the working directory for us. This can also be done by clicking **Session** > **Set Working Directory** > **Choose Directory** and then locate your recently created **r101** directory and click **Open**

I can check my current working directory by using:

```r
getwd()
```

```
## [1] "C:/Users/dpaudel/Desktop/r101"
```


We can see the files inside the folder by using the following codes:

```r
list.files()
```

```
## [1] "irisdata.csv" "r101_1a.html" "r101_1a.md"   "r101_1a.Rmd"
```
The list shows that the dataset we will be using (_irisdata.csv_) is present in our working directory **r101**.
